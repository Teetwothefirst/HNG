MOBILE TRACK STAGE 3 TASK
Hello Mobile Ninjas! :sunglasses::iphone:
Welcome to Stage 3!
By now you’ve built your quiz app and your storekeeper app, learning how to connect screens, handle logic and manage data. Now it’s time to focus on design accuracy and recreate real-world interfaces with precision.
This stage is all about implementing a Mobile Wallpaper Selector App using the provided Figma design, while paying close attention to every visual detail.

Task Description
Your task is to recreate the UI screens pixel perfectly, following the design exactly as provided. Match the fonts, colors, spacing, padding and alignment. Pay close attention to layout, typography and responsiveness, and ensure the design is consistent across all screens.
Here is the Figma Link
When you’re done, submit your public GitHub repository containing your complete source code and README, along with a two to four minute demo video that showcases your app’s full flow and user interactions.
Your README should include the release APK file or a direct download link, your GitHub and demo video links, and step-by-step setup instructions for running the app. Present everything in a clear, well-organized format that’s easy to read and navigate.
PS: Some Flutter Developers will be assigned to implement the desktop version while others will focus on the mobile screens. React Native and Kotlin interns will implement the mobile screens only.
There will be a call today by 6pm to assign Flutter developers to either the mobile or desktop implementation, so be on the lookout for it on the #track-mobile channel.

NOTE: This stage focuses on precision and design. It evaluates how closely your implementation follows the mockup. Pay attention to small details such as alignment, spacing and typography, and build it as if it is going straight into production.
You have less than five days to complete this task. Use the time wisely to refine every detail, double-check consistency across screens, and ensure your build accurately reflects the design.
See you in Stage 4.
The journey to mastery begins with a single line of code :rocket:
