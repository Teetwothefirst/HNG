Hi Quality Alchemist-zzzz @channel :wave:
:rocket:Stage 3A Task – Automate API Testing & Generate Reports Using Postman & Newman
Explainer Video
This stage builds upon Stage 2, where you manually tested the APIs:
 :link: Gradific API
 :link: Delve API
Now, you will automate those test cases using Postman and Newman, ensuring robust validation, performance monitoring, and structured reporting.
Interns are expected to apply best practices in API automation, including error handling, validation, and basic security testing to simulate real-world QA workflows.
:dart: Objectives
Automate API testing using Postman test scripts (Pre-request & Test scripts).
Execute API tests and generate detailed reports.
Validate API request/response structure, status codes, and error handling.
Ensure data integrity and test basic performance/security aspects.
:jigsaw: Requirements
Use of Variables for Reusability
Use Collection Variables for base URLs, authentication tokens, headers, and dynamic data.
Avoid using Environment Variables — keep everything within the collection.
2. Postman Automation & JavaScript Test Scripts
Write JavaScript-based assertions inside Postman test tabs.
Use Faker.js (Postman’s built-in library) for dynamic data generation.
3. Newman CLI Execution & Reporting
Run automated tests using Newman CLI.
Generate JSON and HTML reports.
4. Assertions & Validation
Validate response status codes, response structure, and error messages.
Ensure data consistency across multiple requests (e.g., create → read → update → delete).
Test Scenarios
Automated API Test Scenarios
Use the same API documentation you worked with in Stage 2.
CRUD Operations – Validate create (POST), retrieve (GET), update (PUT/PATCH), delete (DELETE).
Error Handling – Test invalid or missing parameters.
Security Tests – Unauthorized access, wrong credentials, restricted endpoints.
2. Data Integrity & Performance Testing
Check for consistent data across multiple calls.
Measure API response times (recommended max: 500ms).
Simulate high-traffic conditions using batch or repeated requests.
:package: Deliverables
Automated API Test Scripts
Submit:
Postman Collection (shared via public link).
All requests must use Collection Variables.
Include JavaScript test scripts for assertions and validations.
2. Newman Test Reports
Submit:
JSON and HTML reports generated from Newman CLI execution.
3. Bug Reports & Execution Logs (in Google Sheet)
Submit using the following format:
Issue Title: Short description of the bug
 Steps to Reproduce: How to replicate the issue
 Expected Behaviour: What should happen
 Actual Behaviour: What happened instead
 Severity: Low / Medium / High
 Screenshots/Logs: Attach any evidence
